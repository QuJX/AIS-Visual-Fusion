In our new work, the anti-occlusion algorithm is updated and integrated into a more accurate version: if the vessel is matched with its AIS, the occluded location will be predicted with the AIS data, if no matching, the location will be predicted via historical visual trajectory (as this paper introduced). The fusion algorithm is also updated to a trajecory-based matching method, which is more accurate. The source code will be avialable after the review of our new paper:

For more dataset about vessel detection the simultaneous data about video and AIS data fusion, please see our newest work: https://github.com/gy65896/FVessel, where the source code will be also available after the paper publishment.

Thanks for the following of our work!!!
